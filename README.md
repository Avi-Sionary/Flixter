## Flix Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [x] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [x] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### App Walkthough GIF
`TODO://` Add the URL to your animated app walkthough `gif` in the image tag below, `YOUR_GIF_URL_HERE`. Make sure the gif actually renders and animates when viewing this README. (üö´ Remove this paragraph after after adding gif)

<img src="YOUR_GIF_URL_HERE" width=250><br>

### Notes
- Changed background to black and text to whtie because it looks nicer IMO.
- Added voter average for each movie.
- RecyclerViews and ViewHolders wouldn't automatically show up when coding them into the XML files, made things confusing.
- Placing and sizing objects in Design view was annoying.
- A lot of problems with connecting to the internet in the emulator when working on this. 

### Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Androids
